# F2e-Turn-Tracker
A turn order track for combat in the Fight! 2nd Edition TTRPG System.

It allows you to add PCs and input their rolls and automates the initiative and controlls rolls for the enemies in a battle. All the rolls are then sorted to give you the turn order that turn.

To run: Copy files, use "npm i" to install the needed node modules, run locally.

TODO: Program the delete buttons. Add the "Round Timer" for the fight. Make it look better.
